<h2>Welcome to Tunview Desktop</h2>
<p>This platform is a System Controller and State Validation Tool built for validating complex microservice and
    database-driven systems, where correctness is defined by the actual persistent state of the system after
    control commands are executed, not just by API responses. It enables automated command execution, real-time
    status tracking, and deep validation of data consistency and state transitions, providing reliable
    verification for distributed and mission-critical environments through HTTP and WebSocket-based communication.
